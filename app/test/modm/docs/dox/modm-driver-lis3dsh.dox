lbuild module: `modm:driver:lis3dsh`

The LIS3DSH is an ultra low-power high performance three-axis linear
accelerometer belonging to the "nano" family with embedded state machine
that can be programmed to implement autonomous applications. The LIS3DSH has
dynamically selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±6g/±8g/±16g and it is capable
of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 3.125 Hz to 1.6 kHz.
